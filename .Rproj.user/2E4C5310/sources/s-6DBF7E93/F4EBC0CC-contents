 As I begin my first semester of my second year at CUNY, I am rife with excitement to take the classes that will be integral to my research plans that I will (hopefully) execute this year, current pandemic pending. Cognitive psychology is a class the class that I have always wanted to take but seems to be the hard evil that opposed the creativity world in which I am currently steeped. Harsh, I am seeing now! Yet as a researcher hoping to examine meaning-making in neurodivergent populations (particularly those with Autism), I know that learning about the foundations of cognitive literature will be imperative to my understanding of the already understudied concept. Meaning-making itself is difficult to define and further difficult to operationalize. While I have my measures set for my second-year project, I have yet to create a well construct model to introduce this concept within the context of an aesthetic experience. I suspect that perception, memory, and learning may all play a role, and am excited to learn about the other underlying mechanisms that I have not yet considered. 
	Additionally, I have noticed in my own department of Developmental psychology, that much of the foundational and seminal literature is predicated on the notions of “normal” populations. As a researcher of neurodivergent populations, it would be incredibly helpful for me to incorporate cognitive neurodivergence into my studies this semester, not only to inform my work for this class but in the hopes of establishing a more inclusive collection of literature for which to build my work.
